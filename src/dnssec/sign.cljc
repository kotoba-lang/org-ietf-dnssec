  "RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS and the NSEC chain — RFC 4034 / 4035, RFC 8080 for Ed25519.

  Crypto is an **injected capability**, never imported. A signer is
  `(fn [algorithm key-material octets] -> signature-octets)` and a digest is
  `(fn [algorithm octets] -> digest-octets)`, both supplied by the caller.

  This is not portability theatre. It is the same boundary
  `kotoba-lang/godaddy-dns` draws around a registrar API and for a stronger
  reason: a library that imported a signing implementation would also have to
  hold, or at least touch, the zone-signing key. Keeping the primitive outside
  means the key can live in an HSM, in `kagi`, or in a JVM `KeyStore`, and this
  code never sees it — the same discipline `cloud-itonami.dns-provider` uses to
  make 'the actor reads a secret' structurally impossible rather than merely
  discouraged.

  It also makes the *serialization* testable on its own, which is the half that
  actually breaks. A DNSSEC bug is almost never in the signature arithmetic; it
  is in which bytes got signed. With an injected signer, a test can assert on
  the exact blob without any crypto at all — see `test/dnssec/sign_test.cljc`,
  where the 'signer' returns the input.

  ## What gets signed

  RFC 4035 §5.3.2, and the order matters:

      RRSIG_RDATA (the RRSIG's own rdata, with an empty signature field)
      || RR(1) || RR(2) || …

  Each `RR(i)` is the canonical form from `dnssec.canonical`, the RRset is in
  canonical order, and the RRSIG rdata prefix includes the type covered,
  algorithm, labels, original TTL, expiration, inception, key tag and signer's
  name. Omitting that prefix — signing only the records — is a real and common
  mistake that produces signatures no validator accepts, because a validator
  reconstructs the blob from the RRSIG it received."
