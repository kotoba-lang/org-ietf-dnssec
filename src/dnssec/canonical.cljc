  "Canonical forms — RFC 4034 §6. This is the whole foundation of DNSSEC and
  the part that silently breaks everything downstream when it is wrong.

  A signature is over *bytes*. If a validator serializes an RRset even one byte
  differently from the signer, every signature fails and the zone goes bogus —
  which looks like a key problem, a clock problem, or a resolver problem, and is
  none of them. So §6 fixes three things exactly:

  **Canonical name form.** All uppercase ASCII letters in owner names are
  lowercased, and names are written **uncompressed**. This is why this namespace
  has its own encoder instead of reusing `nameserver.wire`'s: that one applies
  RFC 1035 name compression, which is correct for a message and fatal here,
  because a compressed name's bytes depend on what else is in the message. The
  same RRset would then sign differently depending on which query produced it.

  **Canonical RR form.** Owner name in canonical form; the **original TTL**
  from the RRSIG, not whatever TTL the record currently carries (a cached copy
  has a decremented TTL and would otherwise fail against a signature made at
  the authoritative server); and, for a fixed list of RR types, embedded domain
  names in the RDATA lowercased too.

  **Canonical RR ordering.** Within an RRset, records sort by their RDATA as
  unsigned left-justified octet sequences — a plain byte comparison, not a
  parse-and-compare. Two servers that order an RRset differently produce
  different signed blobs from the same records.

  There is a fourth ordering, for *names* rather than records, used to build the
  NSEC chain: labels compared right to left, each label as lowercased octets.
  `example.com` sorts before `a.example.com` because the comparison starts at
  the rightmost label and a shorter name is a prefix. Sorting names as ordinary
  strings — the obvious mistake — puts `a.example.com` first and produces an
  NSEC chain that proves nonexistence of the wrong things."
