  "The reference crypto injection for `dnssec.sign` — Ed25519 signing (RFC 8080)
  and SHA-2 digests, wired to `kotoba-lang/ed25519` and the host's own hash.

  `dnssec.sign` takes `sign-fn` and `digest-fn` as arguments and imports no
  crypto, so that a zone-signing key can live in an HSM, in `kagi`, or in a
  JVM `KeyStore` and never pass through the serialization code. That boundary
  is the point, and this namespace does not weaken it: it is **one** possible
  injection, kept separate so a caller with a real key store can ignore it
  entirely and pass their own two functions.

  Requiring `dnssec.canonical` or `dnssec.sign` does not load this namespace,
  so the pure half stays usable without ever touching a key.

  ## Byte representations

  `dnssec.sign` speaks vectors of 0-255 ints; `ed25519.core` speaks host byte
  arrays. The conversion happens here, once, rather than at every call site —
  and it masks on the way back, because `vec` of a JVM `byte[]` yields *signed*
  bytes and a signature whose octets came back as -128 instead of 0x80 will not
  verify against the same signature that went out.

  ## What is deliberately not here

  A **Worker** path. WebCrypto's `digest` and `sign` are asynchronous, and
  `dnssec.sign` is synchronous by construction because the signed blob has to
  be assembled deterministically in one pass. Zone signing is a job, not a
  request handler, so JVM or Node is the right place for it — and pretending
  otherwise would mean an API that returns promises for a computation that has
  no reason to be async."
