;; Compile `kotoba/dnssec/canonical.kotoba` and run the COMPILED artifact.
;;
;; The JVM suite drives the guest through the KIR interpreter, which is not
;; the thing that ships. This runs the `.wasm` the public CLI produces, on
;; real `WebAssembly`, through amu's own `runtime/browser-host.mjs`, and
;; prints what it answered so `test/dnssec/canonical_artifact_test.clj` can hold it against the
;; interpreter.
;;
;; nbb rather than a `.mjs`: this workspace does not add raw JavaScript
;; harnesses (CLAUDE.md, runtime priority).
;;
;; Fuel is spent over the life of an INSTANCE, not per call, so every call
;; gets a fresh one -- the same thing amu's own `runtime/dom-driver.mjs`
;; does per interaction. Reusing one instance answers `unreachable` a few
;; calls in, which reads exactly like a wrong decision.
