;; `kotoba/dnssec/canonical.kotoba` against `dnssec.canonical`.
;;
;; Canonical order is what the NSEC and NSEC3 chains are built on --
;; `compare-names`' own docstring says "every place it disagrees produces an
;; NSEC chain that proves the nonexistence of names that do exist". So the
;; parity here is over the ordering itself, on names chosen to hit the
;; places string order and canonical order disagree, and it is checked as a
;; total order rather than pairwise: the guest and the library must sort the
;; same list the same way.
;;
;; Three findings, each measured.
;;
;;   * `the-fold-is-locale-aware-in-a-function-that-forbids-it` --
;;     `canonical-name`'s docstring says only ASCII `A`-`Z` is folded and
;;     that "a locale-aware or Unicode-aware lower-casing would change
;;     octets the spec requires to be left alone". It calls
;;     `clojure.string/lower-case`. With the default locale set to tr-TR,
;;     `IETF.example` folds to `ıetf.example.` and `encode-name` emits 305,
;;     which is not an octet. The same zone signed on two machines is two
;;     different zones.
;;
;;   * `a-long-label-emits-the-compression-marker` -- `encode-name`'s
;;     docstring is "Never compressed", and it writes `(count l)` as the
;;     length octet with no bound. RFC 1035 §4.1.4 gives the top two bits of
;;     that octet to the pointer form: a 192-character label emits `0xC0`.
;;
;;   * `a-dot-is-not-always-a-separator` -- `labels` splits on every `.`, so
;;     `a\.b.example` (one label containing a dot, §5.1) becomes three
;;     labels, and `a..com` becomes a name with an empty label, whose wire
;;     form carries a zero octet where a name ends.
;;
;; `.cljc` stays the oracle for the wire encoding and the chains and is not
;; required from the guest (require-graph). It did not grow a second copy of
;; the ordering (ADR-2608261100).
